"I’ve worked on personal coding projects to apply what I’ve learned and strengthen my skills. One of my key personal projects was building an e-commerce application, similar to platforms like Flipkart or Amazon. I developed the core features on my own, including user registration and login, product listing, shopping cart functionality, and order history.

The project was built using Java for the backend, and I used servlets and JSP for handling web pages. I also connected it to a MySQL database to store user information, product details, and order records. This project really helped me understand the flow of a full-stack application, database integration, and how to handle sessions, user authentication, and CRUD operations.

What I enjoyed most was designing the logic for the cart and order management, making sure everything updated in real-time and reflected correctly for each user. It gave me hands-on experience in thinking from both a user’s perspective and a developer’s point of view.

I’m currently working on improving this project by integrating Spring Boot and making the UI more dynamic using basic frontend technologies. Doing personal projects like this helps me learn by doing, and it has built my confidence to take on real-world development tasks."
